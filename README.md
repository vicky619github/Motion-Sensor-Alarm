# Motion-Sensor-Alarm
The Motion Sensor Alarm project is a simple IoT-based security system using an Arduino microcontroller, a PIR motion sensor, and an LED. When the PIR sensor detects motion, it triggers an alarm (LED) and sends real-time alerts to the Arduino IoT Cloud, allowing remote monitoring of motion activity via a cloud-based dashboard.
